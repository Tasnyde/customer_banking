# Customer Banking Challenge 

The focus of the project was to create a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. 

## Project Description
The overall intent is for python education, training and learning. The focus of the project was to allow users can enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

### Prerequisites

The starter files consist of the following files: Accounts.py, savings_account.py, cd_account.py, and customer_banking.py. The Accounts.py file contains the Account class with methods to set the balance and interest.

### Installing

The repo is public and can be cloned at:

## Testing

Basic testing was used in Visual Studio Code.

The final output was tested for proper functionality. 
The user is prompted to set the savings balance, interest rate, and months for the savings account. Code is written to print out the interest earned and updated savings account balance with interest earned for the given months. The values are formatted to two decimal places and thousandths.
